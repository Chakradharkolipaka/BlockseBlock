## Blockchain Platform Comparison Report

This report compares three blockchain platforms: Ethereum (Public), Hyperledger Fabric (Private), and Quorum (Consortium).

Ethereum is a public blockchain known for its open participation, decentralized consensus (Proof of Stake), and robust smart contract support using Solidity and Vyper. Its open nature makes it ideal for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi, though its throughput (~30 TPS) is lower than permissioned blockchains.

Hyperledger Fabric is a private, permissioned blockchain designed for enterprise use. It features modular consensus (e.g., Raft), high throughput (1,000+ TPS), and supports smart contracts in multiple languages. Its private channels and pluggable architecture make it suitable for supply chain and business networks among trusted parties.

Quorum, a consortium blockchain, is based on Ethereum but tailored for enterprise and inter-bank applications. It uses permissioned consensus (Istanbul BFT, Raft), supports private transactions, and offers moderate throughput (100+ TPS). Quorum is ideal for financial consortia needing privacy and compliance.

For a decentralized app, Ethereum is preferred due to its openness and developer ecosystem. For a supply chain among known partners, Hyperledger Fabric is optimal for its privacy and performance. For inter-bank financial applications, Quorum is best, offering privacy, compliance, and Ethereum compatibility.
